###1. Definition: Poles and Zeros
For a transfer function or Laplace transform in rational form: H(s) = N(s) / D(s)

-Poles (p):
Roots of the denominator D(s) = 0. Values of s where H(s) → ∞. Poles determine the stability and mode of the system (decay vs oscillation).

-Zeros (z):
Roots of the numerator N(s) = 0. Values of s where H(s) = 0. Zeros affect the magnitude and phase of the transient response.

###2. Stability Analysis (Pole Location)
The real part of the pole, Re(s), determines stability.

-Stable System (Left Half Plane):
Re(p) < 0 The time domain response contains e^(-at). Since lim_(t->∞) e^(-at) = 0, the response decays and system is stable.

-Unstable System (Right Half Plane):
Re(p) > 0 The time domain response contains e^(at). Since lim_(t->∞) e^(at) = ∞, the response grows without bound.

-Marginally Stable (Imaginary Axis):
Re(p) = 0 (e.g., s = ±iw) The time domain response contains sin(wt) or cos(wt). The system oscillates with constant amplitude (Undamped).

###3. System Behavior Types
-Real Poles (No imaginary part):
s = -a y(t) contains e^(-at). System is Overdamped or Critically Damped. Motion: Direct decay, no oscillation.

-Complex Conjugate Poles:
s = -a ± bi y(t) contains e^(-at)cos(bt). System is Underdamped. Motion: Decay with oscillation.

-Real part (-a) controls decay rate.

-Imaginary part (b) controls oscillation frequency.

###4. Final Value Theorem (FVT)
-Purpose:
To find the steady-state value y(∞) directly from Y(s) without inverse Laplace.

-Formula:
lim_(t->∞) f(t) = lim_(s->0) sF(s)

-Condition (Critical!):
The system must be stable. All poles of sF(s) must be in the Left Half Plane (Re < 0). If there are poles in the Right Half Plane, FVT is invalid.

###5. Initial Value Theorem (IVT)
-Purpose:
To find the initial condition y(0) or y(0+) directly from Y(s).

-Formula:
lim_(t->0+) f(t) = lim_(s->∞) sF(s)

-Condition:
F(s) must be a strictly proper fraction (degree of denominator > degree of numerator).

###6. Example Calculation
-Given Y(s) = (3s + 2) / [s(s^2 + 4s + 10)]

-Applying IVT (Start):
y(0) = lim_(s->∞) s * [(3s + 2) / s(s^2 + 4s + 10)] = lim_(s->∞) (3s + 2) / (s^2 + 4s + 10) = 0 (since degree of denominator > numerator)

-Applying FVT (End):
Check stability: s^2 + 4s + 10 has roots -2 ± i√6 (Re < 0, Stable). y(∞) = lim_(s->0) s * [(3s + 2) / s(s^2 + 4s + 10)] cancel s: = (3(0) + 2) / (0^2 + 4(0) + 10) = 2/10 = 1/5

###7. Conclusion
-Poles: Re(s) < 0 → Stable (Decay) Re(s) > 0 → Unstable (Growth) Im(s) ≠ 0 → Oscillation

-Theorems: FVT: s → 0 (for t → ∞) IVT: s → ∞ (for t → 0
