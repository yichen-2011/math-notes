###1. Core Idea

-In transcendence problems involving exponentials, the first step is not computation but classification.
-The choice between Gelfond–Schneider and Lindemann–Weierstrass depends on the relations among exponents, not on the apparent complexity of the expression.

###2. Three Fundamental Cases
##Case 1: Single Power

-Form:
a^α

-Conditions:
-a is algebraic, a ≠ 0,1
-α is an irrational algebraic number

-Tool:
-Gelfond–Schneider

#Conclusion:
-a^α is transcendental

##Case 2: Multiple Exponentials with Independent Exponents

-Form:
e^(α1), e^(α2), ..., e^(αn)

-Conditions:
-αi are algebraic numbers
-αi are pairwise distinct
-no rational linear relation among αi

Tool:
-Lindemann–Weierstrass

#Conclusion:
-e^(α1), ..., e^(αn) are linearly independent over algebraic numbers
-In OR-type problems, at least one must be transcendental

##Case 3: Related Exponents (Danger Zone)

-Form:
-e^a + e^b
-e^(a+b)
-e^a, e^(2a)

-Features:
-Exponents are algebraically or rationally related
-Lindemann–Weierstrass cannot be applied directly

-Method:
-Assume algebraicity
-Construct auxiliary expressions
-Derive contradictions in exponent relations

###3. Key Distinction Between Theorems

Gelfond–Schneider:
-Checks the base

Lindemann–Weierstrass:
-Checks the exponents

##Misidentifying this distinction leads to invalid proofs.

###4. Common Mistakes

-Applying GS to expressions of the form e^x
-Applying LW when exponents are proportional
-Assuming linear independence implies each term is transcendental
-Skipping exponent relation analysis

###5. Practical Checklist

Before choosing a theorem, verify:

-Are all exponents algebraic?
-Are they distinct?
-Are they Q-linearly independent?
-Is the problem linear (sum/OR-type) or nonlinear?

If any answer is unclear, stop and analyze exponent relations first.
