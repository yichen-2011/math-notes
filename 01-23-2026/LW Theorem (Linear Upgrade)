###1. Motivation
Previously, transcendence problems mainly relied on the Gelfond–Schneider theorem, especially for expressions of the form a^α.
However, many competition problems involve expressions like:
-e^x, e^(2x), e^(3x)
or
-e^a, e^b
where a, b, x are algebraic numbers.

In these cases:

-The base is fixed as e
-Gelfond–Schneider cannot be applied
-OR-type arguments based on ratios often fail
-This motivates the use of Lindemann–Weierstrass.

###2. Lindemann–Weierstrass Theorem (Usable Form)

-Let α1, α2, ..., αn be:
-nonzero algebraic numbers
-pairwise distinct

Then:
-e^(α1), e^(α2), ..., e^(αn)
-are linearly independent over the field of algebraic numbers.

##Equivalently:
-For any algebraic numbers c1, c2, ..., cn, not all zero,
c1 e^(α1) + c2 e^(α2) + ... + cn e^(αn) ≠ 0

###3. OR-Type Problems Using Lindemann–Weierstrass

##Goal:
-Prove that at least one number in a set is transcendental.

General template:

#Step 1
-Assume all numbers e^(a1), e^(a2), ..., e^(ak) are algebraic.

#Step 2
-Construct a linear combination:
-c1 e^(a1) + c2 e^(a2) + ... + ck e^(ak)

-where ci are algebraic numbers (often integers or 1).

#Step 3
-Verify the key condition:
-a1, a2, ..., ak are distinct algebraic numbers.

#Step 4
-Apply Lindemann–Weierstrass:
-The linear combination cannot be zero.

#Step 5
-Contradiction, hence at least one of the original numbers is transcendental.

###4. Comparison with Gelfond–Schneider

##Gelfond–Schneider:

Structure: a^α
-Base a is algebraic, a ≠ 0,1
-Exponent α is algebraic irrational

Conclusion: a^α is transcendental

##Lindemann–Weierstrass:

Structure: e^(αi)

-Base fixed as e
-Exponents are algebraic and distinct

Conclusion: linear independence over algebraic numbers

Key distinction:
-GS checks the base
-LW checks the exponents

###5. Common Pitfalls

-Treating e^x as a^α and applying GS
-Forgetting that LW requires distinct exponents
-Assuming LW implies each term is transcendental (it implies linear independence)
-Avoiding linear combinations instead of constructing them
-Avoiding linear combinations instead of constructing them
IMO Shortlist transcendence selection problems
