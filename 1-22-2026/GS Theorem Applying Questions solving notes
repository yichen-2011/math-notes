# Transcendental Numbers — OR-Type Problems (Proof Template)

## Problem Structure

Typical statement:

Let x be an algebraic number.

Prove that at least one of the following numbers is transcendental:

A(x)^(α), B(x)^(α)

where:
A(x), B(x) are algebraic expressions in x  
α is an irrational algebraic number

Such problems are called OR-type transcendence problems.

## Fundamental Strategy

The key idea is NOT to prove each expression is transcendental separately.

Correct approach:

Assume both expressions are algebraic.  
Construct a new exponential expression from them.  
Force an application of the Gelfond–Schneider theorem.  
Derive a contradiction.

## Standard Contradiction Template

### Step 1: Contradiction Assumption

Assume:

A(x)^(α) and B(x)^(α) are both algebraic numbers.

### Step 2: Construct a New Power

Form a ratio or product:

(A(x) / B(x))^(α)  
or  
(A(x) * B(x))^(α)

Choose the form that simplifies the base.

### Step 3: Analyze the Base

Let:

a = A(x) / B(x)  
or  
a = A(x) * B(x)

Verify explicitly:

a is algebraic  
a ≠ 0  
a ≠ 1

This step is mandatory and cannot be skipped.

### Step 4: Apply Gelfond–Schneider

If:

a is algebraic and a ≠ 0,1  
α is an irrational algebraic number

Then:

a^(α) is transcendental.

### Step 5: Contradiction

Since a^(α) is constructed from algebraic numbers,  
it must be algebraic under the assumption.

This contradicts the Gelfond–Schneider theorem.

### Step 6: Handle Exceptional Cases

Explicitly check cases where Step 3 fails:

a = 0  
a = 1  
expression undefined

These cases usually reduce to simple direct applications of the theorem.

## Common Logical Errors

Do not:

Claim both expressions are transcendental directly  
Ignore the case a = 1  
Apply Gelfond–Schneider without checking the base  
Treat irrationality of the exponent as sufficient  
Ignore domain issues such as negative bases

## Minimal Checklist Before Using Gelfond–Schneider

Is the base algebraic  
Is the base different from 0 and 1  
Is the exponent algebraic  
Is the exponent irrational

If any answer is no, stop and change strategy.

## Typical Applications

x^(α) vs (x + 1)^(α)  
(x + 1)^(α) vs (x − 1)^(α)  
x^(α) vs (x^2 + 1)^(α)  
Algebraic functions sharing common zeros or ones

## Key Insight

In OR-type problems:

The goal is not transcendence of each expression,  
but impossibility of simultaneous algebraicity.
