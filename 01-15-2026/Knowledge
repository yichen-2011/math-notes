## Algebraic Dependence and Polynomial Construction

This section summarizes a core competition technique:
constructing polynomial equations to determine whether a number
can be algebraic or must be transcendental.

### 1️ Core Principle

A number is algebraic if and only if it is a root of a non-zero
polynomial with integer coefficients.

Therefore, to test algebraicity, the key question is:
Can we construct a polynomial equation satisfied by the number?

### 2️ Basic Structure: u + 1/u

Let:
u ≠ 0  
x = u + 1/u

Multiply both sides by u:
xu = u^2 + 1

Rearrange:
u^2 - x u + 1 = 0

Conclusion:
If x is algebraic, then u is algebraic,
since algebraic numbers are closed under solving polynomial equations.

### 3️ Higher Powers: u^n + 1/u^n

Starting from:
x = u + 1/u

Square:
x^2 = u^2 + 2 + 1/u^2

So:
u^2 + 1/u^2 = x^2 - 2

Cube:
(u + 1/u)^3 = u^3 + 3u + 3/u + 1/u^3

Thus:
u^3 + 1/u^3 = x^3 - 3x

General Result:
For all integers n ≥ 1,
u^n + 1/u^n can be expressed as a polynomial P_n(x)
with integer coefficients.

This shows algebraic dependence between u and x.

### 4️ Algebraic Closure Properties

The set of algebraic numbers is closed under:
+ , − , × , ÷ , and solving polynomial equations.

Therefore:
If a number can be expressed using only these operations
from algebraic inputs, it remains algebraic.

### 5️ Non-Closure Under Transcendental Functions

Algebraic numbers are not closed under:
exp(x), log(x), sin(x), cos(x)

Key Result (Competition Form):
If a ≠ 0 is algebraic, then e^a is transcendental
(Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem).

### 6️ Standard Competition Contradiction Pattern

1. Assume a given expression x is algebraic.
2. Construct a polynomial equation involving x.
3. Deduce that e^(algebraic) must be algebraic.
4. This contradicts transcendence results.
5. Therefore, x is transcendental.

### 7️ Representative Example

Let:
x = e^(sqrt(2)) + e^(-sqrt(2))

Set:
u = e^(sqrt(2))

Then:
x = u + 1/u
u^2 - x u + 1 = 0

If x were algebraic, then u would be algebraic.
But sqrt(2) is a non-zero algebraic number, and e^(sqrt(2))
is transcendental.

This is a contradiction.
Hence, x is transcendental.
