### Question
Let x=e^root2 + e^-root2 + e^root3 + e^-root3.
Determine whether x is algebraic or transcendental, and prove your conclusion.

### First thought
Use Lindermann-Weierstrass rule!

x=e^root2 + e^-root2 + e^root3 + e^-root3. 
because root2 don't = to -root2 don't equal to root3 don't = -root3, also because of lindemann-weierstrass rule, the sum of these is not algebraic. 
so x is not algebraic

### FInal Anwser
let y=e^root2+e^-root2, z=e^root3+e^-root3.       
so x=y+z.       
make x belongs to set Q.     
so y,z belongs to set Q too.       
let u=e^root2, v=e^root3, 
so u+1/u,v+1/v belongs to set Q.
->u,v belongs to set Q.            
so e^root2 and e^root3 was linear independent.           
use Lindemann-Weierstrass rule,      
exponents +-root2 and +-root3 were linear independent        
so 1/u +u+1/v+v is transcendental, which is opposite with the hypothesis.      
so x is transcendental
