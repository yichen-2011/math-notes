# Problem

## Question

Let x be a nonzero algebraic number.
Prove that at least one of the following numbers is transcendental:
x^(sqrt(2)) , (x + 1)^(sqrt(2))

## First Thought

Things can get from the question: 
the exponent of the two numbers were irrational algebraic numbers; 
bases were algebraic; two failure situation: x+1=0, x=1. 

###Emphasis: both were algebraic. 

###SOLVE: 

####situation1: x /=+- 1. 

so the base could pass the GS Theorem. 
BY using the GS theorem, both were transcendental. 

####situation2: x=1. 

So x+1=2, so it equals to 1^sprt2, 2^sqrt2. 
Applying the GS theorem, the first isn't, but the second must be. 

####Situation3: x=-1. 
SO x+1=0. 
APply GS theorem, the first is -1^sqrt2, second is 0^sqrt2. 
the second can't be, but the first one must. 

###Conclusion: at least one is transcendental. Proofed.

## FINAL Answer

###Proof.

Assume, for contradiction, that both
x^(sqrt(2)) and (x+1)^(sqrt(2))
are algebraic numbers.

###Step 1: Construct a new exponential

Consider the ratio:

(x^(sqrt(2))) / ((x+1)^(sqrt(2)))
= (x / (x+1))^(sqrt(2))

###Step 2: Analyze the base

Since x is algebraic and x ≠ 0, -1,
a = x / (x+1) is algebraic

a ≠ 0, 1 (check directly)

The exponent sqrt(2) is an irrational algebraic number.

Step 3: Apply Gelfond–Schneider

By the Gelfond–Schneider theorem:

(x / (x+1))^(sqrt(2)) is transcendental.

But this contradicts the assumption that the ratio of two algebraic numbers is algebraic.

###Step 4: Handle exceptional cases

If x = 1, then (x+1)^(sqrt(2)) = 2^(sqrt(2)) is transcendental

If x = -1, then (-1)^(sqrt(2)) = e^(iπ sqrt(2)) is transcendental

###Conclusion

At least one of
x^(sqrt(2)) , (x+1)^(sqrt(2))
is transcendental.
