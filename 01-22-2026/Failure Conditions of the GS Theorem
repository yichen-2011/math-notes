# Transcendental Numbers — Failure Conditions of the Gelfond–Schneider Theorem

## Necessary Conditions Review

The Gelfond–Schneider theorem requires all of the following:

1. a is algebraic
2. a ≠ 0, 1
3. b is an irrational algebraic number

If any condition fails, the conclusion does not hold.

## Case 1: a = 1

If a = 1, then:

1^b = 1 for all b

- 1 is algebraic
- 1^b is always algebraic

Allowing a = 1 would immediately produce counterexamples.

Essential reason:
The exponential structure collapses when the base is 1.

---

## Case 2: a = 0

- If b > 0, then 0^b = 0 (algebraic)
- If b < 0, then 0^b is undefined
- If b = 0, then 0^0 is undefined

Conclusion:
a = 0 is excluded due to degeneracy or undefined behavior.

---

## Case 3: b is Rational

Let b = p/q in lowest terms, with q > 0.

Then:

a^b = a^(p/q)  
(a^b)^q = a^p

If a is algebraic:
- a^p is algebraic
- a^b satisfies x^q - a^p = 0

Therefore:
a^b is algebraic.

Conclusion:
If b is rational, a^b can never be transcendental by Gelfond–Schneider.

## Common Trap Example

Let:

a = 2  
b = log_2 3  

Then:

a^b = 3 (algebraic)

Note:
b = ln(3) / ln(2)

The algebraic nature of b is unknown (and believed to be transcendental).

Therefore:
Gelfond–Schneider theorem cannot be applied.

## Comparison with Lindemann–Weierstrass Boundaries

- Lindemann–Weierstrass fails when the exponent is 0 or linearly dependent
- Gelfond–Schneider fails when:
  - a = 0 or 1
  - b is rational
  - b is not algebraic

The failure regions of the two theorems are fundamentally different.

## Pre-Application Checklist (Competition Use)

Before applying Gelfond–Schneider, verify:

- a is algebraic
- a ≠ 0, 1
- b is algebraic
- b is irrational

If any check fails, the theorem cannot be used.
