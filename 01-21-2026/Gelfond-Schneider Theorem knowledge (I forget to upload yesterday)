# Transcendental Numbers — Gelfond–Schneider Theorem

## Theorem Statement

Let a and b satisfy:

- a is an algebraic number
- a ≠ 0, 1
- b is an irrational algebraic number

Then:

a^b is a transcendental number.

This theorem provides a criterion for transcendence of algebraic powers with algebraic irrational exponents.

## Comparison with Lindemann–Weierstrass

Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem concerns numbers of the form:

e^α, where α ≠ 0 is algebraic

Gelfond–Schneider theorem concerns numbers of the form:

a^b, where:
- a is algebraic (a ≠ 0,1)
- b is algebraic but irrational

Key difference:
- Gelfond–Schneider does not rely on e
- It establishes transcendence for algebraic bases raised to algebraic irrational powers

## Classical Examples

### Example 1: 2^(sqrt(2))

- a = 2 (algebraic, ≠ 0,1)
- b = sqrt(2) (irrational algebraic)

Conclusion:
2^(sqrt(2)) is transcendental.

This result cannot be obtained using Lindemann–Weierstrass alone.

### Example 2: (-1)^(sqrt(2))

(-1)^(sqrt(2)) = e^(iπ sqrt(2))

- a = -1 (algebraic, ≠ 0,1)
- b = sqrt(2) (irrational algebraic)

Conclusion:
(-1)^(sqrt(2)) is transcendental.

## Competition Usage Template

Typical proof strategy:

1. Assume x is algebraic
2. Rewrite x or a power of x in the form a^b
3. Check:
   - a is algebraic and a ≠ 0,1
   - b is algebraic and irrational
4. Apply Gelfond–Schneider theorem
5. Contradiction → x is transcendental

## Scope
Gelfond–Schneider theorem is one of the few transcendence results directly usable in Olympiad-level problems.
