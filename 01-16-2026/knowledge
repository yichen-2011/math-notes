## Algebraic Independence and Multi-term Exponentials

This section summarizes a core competition technique:
using the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem to determine
transcendence of sums of exponentials with algebraic exponents.

### 1️ Core Principle

If n_a1, n_a2, ..., n_an are algebraic numbers that are linearly independent over Q,  
then e^n_a1, e^n_a2, ..., e^n_an are algebraically independent.

Therefore, to test whether a sum like
x = e^n_a1 + e^n_a2 + e^n_a3 + ... + e^n_an
is algebraic, the key question is:
Do the exponents form a linearly independent set of algebraic numbers?

### 2️ Basic Two-term Example

Let:
x = e^sqrt2 + e^-sqrt2

Set:
u = e^sqrt2

Then:
x = u + 1/u

Construct the polynomial:
u^2 - x u + 1 = 0

Conclusion:
If x were algebraic, then u would be algebraic.
But n_a = sqrt2 is non-zero algebraic, so e^n_a is transcendental.
Contradiction → x is transcendental.

### 3️ Four-term Sum Example

Let:
x = e^sqrt2 + e^-sqrt2 + e^sqrt3 + e^-sqrt3

Set:
u = e^sqrt2, v = e^sqrt3

Define:
y = u + 1/u, z = v + 1/v

Then:
x = y + z

Assume x is algebraic → y and z would also be algebraic.
But e^n_a with n_a = sqrt2, sqrt3 are transcendental (linearly independent algebraic exponents).  
Contradiction → x is transcendental.

### 4️ General Pattern

1. Assume a sum of exponentials x is algebraic.  
2. Group terms as u + 1/u, v + 1/v, ...  
3. Construct corresponding polynomials for each group.  
4. Apply Lindemann–Weierstrass: e^n_a with non-zero algebraic n_a are transcendental.  
5. Contradiction shows x is transcendental.

### 5️ Key Takeaways

- Any sum of e^n_a where n_a are linearly independent algebraic numbers is transcendental.  
- Polynomial construction using u + 1/u (or higher powers) is the standard tool.  
- This method generalizes to any finite sum of exponentials with distinct algebraic exponents.
