###1. Motivation

After mastering OR-type transcendence problems using Lindemann–Weierstrass, a new difficulty appears.

Many competition problems no longer ask whether at least one number is transcendental, but instead involve expressions such as:

-e^a + e^b
-e^a, e^(a+b)
-e^a + e^(2a)

where a, b are algebraic numbers.

##In these cases:

-The base is still fixed as e
-Lindemann–Weierstrass may not apply directly
-The exponents may be algebraically related
-Linear OR-type arguments can fail
-This forces an analysis of relations among exponents

###2. Core Idea: Exponent Relations Matter

Lindemann–Weierstrass does not depend on the size of exponents, but on their relations.

If:
-α1, α2, ..., αn are algebraic numbers
-and are linearly independent over Q

Then:
-e^(α1), e^(α2), ..., e^(αn)
-are linearly independent over the algebraic numbers

Conversely (competition usage):

-If a nontrivial algebraic linear relation exists among e^(αi)
-Then the exponents αi must satisfy a rational linear relation

###3. When Lindemann–Weierstrass is Safe

LW can be applied directly if:

-All exponents are algebraic
-All exponents are pairwise distinct
-No rational linear relation exists among the exponents
-The problem concerns linear combinations or OR-type statements

Typical safe examples:

-e^x, e^(2x), e^(3x) with x ≠ 0
-e^a, e^b with a/b irrational

###4. Dangerous Situations (Must Stop and Check)

LW cannot be applied blindly if:

-The exponents are proportional (a = qb)
-The exponents differ by an algebraic shift (a+b)
-The expression involves sums like e^a + e^b
-The problem asks whether a sum or product is algebraic

These situations require exponent relation analysis before choosing a theorem.

###5. Typical Advanced Problem Types

Type A: Algebraic sum
-Decide whether e^a + e^b can be algebraic

Type B: Related exponents
-Analyze e^a, e^(2a), e^(3a) beyond OR-type reasoning

Type C: Choice of theorem
-Determine whether GS, LW, or neither applies

###6. Key Mental Checklist

Before applying Lindemann–Weierstrass, ask:

-Are the exponents algebraic?
-Are they distinct?
-Are they linearly independent over Q?
-Is the conclusion about linear relations, not individual transcendence?

If any answer is unclear, pause and analyze exponent relations first.
