### Definition
A transcendental number is a real or complex number that is not a root of any non-zero polynomial with integer coefficients.

Formally, x is transcendental if there does not exist
a_n x^n + a_(n-1) x^(n-1) + ... + a_0 = 0
with a_i in Z.

### Comparing
rational numbers:can be written as p/q
algebraic numbers:roots of integer polonomial functions
transcendental numbers:not algebraic

### Examples
e
pi

### conclusion
algebraic numbe:countable
real numbers: uncountable
->transcendental numbers: uncountable
