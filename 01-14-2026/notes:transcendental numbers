### Definition
A transcendental number is a real or complex number that is not a root of any non-zero polynomial with integer coefficients.

Formally, x is transcendental if there does not exist
a_n x^n + a_(n-1) x^(n-1) + ... + a_0 = 0
with a_i in Z.

### Comparing
rational numbers:can be written as p/q
algebraic numbers:roots of integer polonomial functions
transcendental numbers:not algebraic

### Examples
e
pi

### Conclusion
algebraic numbe:countable
real numbers: uncountable
->transcendental numbers: uncountable

### Use
1.if e^a(a is an algebraic number,a don't = to 0),then e^a is transcentendal number
2.api(a is an algebraic number and don't = to 0), then a*pi is transcentendal number
3.if sin x belongs to Q set, x don't = to 0, then x is transcentendal number(usually)
